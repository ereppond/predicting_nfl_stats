Click [here](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) to see the website where the rushing stats come from.

> This repository was made to predict NFL Rushing statistics for running backs. The predictions were made off of the differences in yards per year as well as many other differences in classic running backs' statistics each year. The age, weight, and team of each player is also accounted for in the predictive modeling.
